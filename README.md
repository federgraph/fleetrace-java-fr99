## FR99

This is the src directory of my FR99 project which I have inside of an Eclipse workspace.

I am using:

```
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
Version: 2019-03 (4.11.0)
```

This project is more than 10 years old and needs an update.
I plan to do the update later this year.

- For now I have formatted the whole project in Eclipse.
- I am running against JDK 12.
- It compiles.
- I do not see any Problems listed.
- I have set up a run-configuration named FR99, 
  which uses org.riggvar.fr99.FR62 as the main class.
- I can start the program up and it seems to work.

FR99 is a client program very similar to Delphi FR01, see other repository.
