### js08

I did not want to reinvent the wheel and implement a scoring engine.

The code in this directory was originally taken/forked from the original javascore java project.

- This package is self contained.
- You could turn the js08 package into a library.
- I have done this another setup.
- But here I want to have everything in one project.

You could replace the scoring code with your own.

I am building a program which uses a more or lesss javascore compatible scoring code.

Code in sibling packages is driving the scoring code here.
