### js08

I did not want to reinvent the wheel and implement a scoring engine for sailing.

The code in this directory was originally taken/forked from the *javascore* java project.

- This package is self contained.
- You could turn the package into a library, I have done this in another setup.
- You can replace the scoring code with your own.

Code in sibling packages is driving the scoring code in this package.
